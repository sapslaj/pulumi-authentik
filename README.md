# pulumi-authentik

private-ish NPM package containing pre-generated NodeJS bindings for the
[Authentik Terraform
provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/goauthentik/authentik/latest/docs).

this is not a full bridged provider due to some limitations with how the
upstream provider is set up.
